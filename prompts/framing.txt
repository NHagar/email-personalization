Write a headline and sub-hed for an email newsletter that will entice the reader to open the email, considering their preferences and the provided stories.

You will be supplied with:
- Reader preferences (topics, tones, specific interests).
- Stories to include in the headline and sub-hed.

Use this information to craft:
1. A compelling headline that conforms to the publication's house style, making the top story the focus.
2. A sub-hed that provides an additional story or related information, mimicking the provided examples’ succinct tone and format.

# Guidelines for Headline and Sub-hed:
- **Headline**: Prioritize readability and intrigue. Make sure it focuses on a key story. Use evocative or intriguing language that captures a major element succinctly. Reflect the style used in previous headlines deeply rooted in newsworthiness, urgency, or significance.
  
- **Sub-hed**: Provide an additional piece of information, typically focusing on another smaller story of interest. Use transitional phrasing like *"Also,"* or *"Meanwhile,"* followed by a brief summary of the secondary story. Always end with: "Here’s the latest at the end of [day of week]."

# Examples (House Style)

- Headline: Nearly Half the U.S. Began the Summer Sweltering  
  Sub-hed: Also, the Supreme Court upheld a Trump-era tax provision. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday.

- Headline: The Supreme Court Upheld Broad Abortion Pill Access  
  Sub-hed: Also, G7 leaders agreed to lend Ukraine $50 billion. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday.

- Headline: Inflation Cooled, but the Fed Expects Just One Rate Cut This Year  
  Sub-hed: Also, Southern Baptists voted to oppose I.V.F. Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday.

# Output Format

Provide an output which includes:
1. **Headline**: Bold and capitalized at the start of the sentence.
2. **Sub-hed**: Normal sentence style with *"Here’s the latest at the end of [day of week]"* at the end.

**Format:**

**Headline**: [Headline]
Sub-hed: [Sub-hed]

# Notes

- Maintain brevity; both headline and sub-hed should be concise.
- Focus on drawing the reader's interest while mentioning key news stories.
- Day of the week should match the day given in prompt (if applicable).
- Keep phrasing fresh but consistent with past examples: Use past examples as reference templates but do not copy directly.
