## Key Information about this research study:
The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether to be a part of this study. Information that is more detailed is explained later on in this form.
-	The purpose of this study is to evaluate news readers’ headline preferences.
-	You will be asked to complete a brief survey.
- We expect that you will be in this research study for 15 minutes.
- The primary potential risk of participation is stress from reading news headlines.

We cannot tell you every detail of this study ahead of time, but if you are willing to participate under these conditions, we will explain the procedure to you fully after your participation.

## Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?
We are asking you to take part in this research study because you are a U.S.-based New York Times reader.

## How many people will be in this study?
We expect about 100 people will be in this research study.

## What should I know about participating in a research study?
-	Whether or not you take part is up to you.
-	You can choose not to take part.
-	You can agree to take part and later change your mind.
-	Your decision will not be held against you.
-	You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.
-	You do not have to answer any question you do not want to answer.

## What happens if I say, “Yes, I want to be in this research”?
You will be asked to fill out a survey. First, you will be presented with a list of recent news headlines and asked to select the ones that interest you. Then, you will be given a pair of news headlines, and asked to select the one you prefer. You will be given 10 pairs of news headlines to evaluate. This survey should take approximately 15 minutes.

## Will being in this study help me in any way?
We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. However, possible benefits include contributing to technological research that helps news organizations better connect with their audiences.

## Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?
As some people find news coverage stressful, reading recent headlines on a range of topics (e.g., the U.S. presidential election, the war in Ukraine) could cause participants discomfort. While this is a fairly likely risk, we anticipate it will be minor and temporary.

A possible risk for any research is that confidentiality could be compromised – that is, that people outside the study might get hold of confidential study information.  We will do everything we can to minimize this risk, as described in more detail later in this form.

## What happens if I do not want to be in this research, or I change my mind later?
Participation in research is voluntary. You can decide to participate or not to participate.  If you do not want to be in this study or withdraw from the study at any point, your decision will not affect your relationship with Northwestern University.

You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you.
If you decide to withdraw from this study, the researchers will ask you if the information already collected from you can be used.

## How will the researchers protect my information?
We plan to store participants’ survey responses, tied only to an anomyized ID, in a database that we will persist through a secure, encrypted cloud storage environment maintained by Northwestern University.

## Who will have access to the information collected during this research study?
Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy.
There are reasons why information about you may be used or seen by other people beyond the research team during or after this study.   Examples include:
-	University officials, government officials, study funders, auditors, and the Institutional Review Board may need access to the study information to make sure the study is done in a safe and appropriate manner.

## How might the information collected in this study be shared in the future?
We will keep the information we collect about you during this research study for study recordkeeping, and for potential use in future research projects.
De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research community, with journals in which study results are published, and with databases and data repositories used for research. We will remove or code any personal information that could directly identify you before the study data are shared. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee the anonymity of your personal data.

## Will I be paid or given anything for taking part in this study?
You will receive payment via Prolific, at a rate of $15/hr, for your participation in this study.
